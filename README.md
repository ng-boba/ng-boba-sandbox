ngBoba Seed
===================================
> Angular Dependency Manager Seed Project

This project is a sample application for a basic ngBoba project.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your AngularJS webapp project
with ngBoba support for production and development.

## Getting Started
To get started you can clone the ngboba-seed repository and install the dependencies.

# Contact & Thanks
For more information about ngBoba please check out [ngBoba.](http://ng-boba.github.io/)

You'll notice a similarity between this documentation and the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
project. That's because the format and wording was lifted heavily
from that project's documentation. Thanks guys!
